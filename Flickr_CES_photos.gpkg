River CES Photo Layer (Filtered by PUD)
This layer contains 40,743 georeferenced photographs classified as river-related Cultural Ecosystem Services (CES). The data was extracted from an initial pool of 754,676 Flickr images using a deep learning image classification model based on ResNet152, which achieved a global accuracy of 0.91.

Each photo was assigned to one of five CES categories:
Aesthetic Values, Recreational Values, Cultural Heritage, Fauna Fascination, and Flora Fascination.

Model performance varied by category, with high F1-scores (0.89â€“0.99) and particularly strong recall for Aesthetic and Non-river CES categories, indicating reliable classification of visually distinctive landscape elements.

After classification, a Photo-User-Day (PUD) filter was applied to retain only high-confidence observations. The PUD filter reduces temporal and user bias by aggregating photos per user per day, ensuring that each record reflects a unique visit rather than repetitive uploads. This filtering step resulted in a final set of 40,743 photos (5% of the original dataset) that best represent spatial patterns of river CES presence.

Each point in the layer includes geographic coordinates and the predicted CES category, making it suitable for spatial analysis, validation, and mapping of river-related cultural values.
